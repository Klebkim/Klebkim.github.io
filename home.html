    <h2>AND Gate</h2>
     <p>An AND gate is a basic logic gate and it means both of the inputs have to be true in order for the output to be true. The symbol for the AND gate is ^ in truth table and a half circle in circuits. </p>

     <h2>Not Gate</h2>
     <p>A NOT gate is a logic gate similar to AND Gate but it is quite special because it only has 1 input. The NOT Gate makes the output exact opposite of input. For example, if P is true, then the output is false. The symbol for the NOT gate is ã„± in truth table and a triange with a dot in circuits. </p>

     <br>
    <h2>Or Gate</h2>
    <p>An Or gate, again, is a basic logic gate and either one of the inputs have to be true in order for the output to be true. The symbol for the OR gate is V in truth table and a curve on the side and a curve on the bottom in the circuits.</p>

    <h2>XOR gate</h2>
    <p>A XOR gate means exclusive-or and it is a gate formed with 2 NOT gates, 2 AND gates, and 1 OR gate. The 2 inputs have to be different in order the outcome has to be true. THe symbol for the XOR gate on the circiut is the OR gate but just on more curve on the bottom.</p>

    <h2>Transistors</h2>
    <p>A transistor contorls how much the voltage flows and it acts like a switch by the electricity flowing. The transistor has 3 legs which are called the base, the collector, the emmitter. </p>
