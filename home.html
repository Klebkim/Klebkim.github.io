    <h2>AND Gate</h2>
     <p>An AND gate is a basic logic gate and it means both of the inputs have to be true in order for the output to be true. The symbol for the AND gate is ^ in truth table and a half circle in circuits. </p>

     <br>
     <h2>Not Gate</h2>
     <p>A NOT gate is a logic gate similar to AND Gate but it is quite special because it only has 1 input. The NOT Gate makes the output exact opposite of input. For example, if P is true, then the output is false. The symbol for the NOT gate is ã„± in truth table and a triange with a dot in circuits. </p>

     <br>
    <h2>Or Gate</h2> 
     <p>An Or gate, again, is a basic logic gate and either one of the inputs have to be true in order for the output to be true. The symbol for the OR gate is V in truth table and a curve on the side and a curve on the bottom in the circuits.</p>

    <h2>XOR gate</h2>
    <p>A XOR gate means exclusive-or and it is a gate formed with 2 NOT gates, 2 AND gates, and 1 OR gate. The 2 inputs have to be different in order the outcome has to be true. THe symbol for the XOR gate on the circiut is the OR gate but just on more curve on the bottom.</p>

    <h2>Transistors</h2>
    <p>A transistor contorls how much the voltage flows and it acts like a switch by the electricity flowing. The transistor has 3 legs which are called the base, the collector, the emmitter. </p>

    <h1>HW</h1>
    <p>In the computer, there are mainly CPU, RAM, motherboard, storage and more. This homework is about computers and their components and their tasks.</p>

    <h2>AC/DC (Power)</h2>
    <p>The difference between AC and DC is the way current flows. AC flows back and forth and DC flows straight. Examples of AC in real life could be washing machine, refrigerator, and air conditioners. Some real life examples for DC might be a cell phone, TV, and computers</p>

    <h2>CPU</h2>
    <p>CPU stands for central Processing Unitis the main part of the computer and I like to call it the most active one. Their task is to computate around. They also have a fan to keep it cool since it might burn.</p>

    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory and by RAM it means short term memory such as browsing the internet, editing spreadsheet, and such. </p>

    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p>Motherboard is called a motherboard because it is a mother of the board. It connects all the things needed such as memmory, hardware, and bunch of wires.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>There are two different storages called Solid State Drive and Hard drive. Hard drive is cheaper and has more space but Solid State Drive is faster, lighter, more durable, and less energy.</p>
